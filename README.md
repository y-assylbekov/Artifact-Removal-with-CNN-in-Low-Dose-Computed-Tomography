# Artifact Removal with CNN in Low-Dose Computed Tomography
In this project, I train U-Net type Neural Network from scratch to remove artifacts in low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) in medial imaging. The use of U-Net type architecure in CT was proposed in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03679">[1]</a> of Jin et al.
